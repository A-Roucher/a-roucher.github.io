This repository contains contents hosted my personal website. 
It is a fork from the excellent work by [Jake Tae](https://jaketae.github.io).

While the actual posts themselves are located in the `_posts` directory, some posts can be written as notebooks in `_jupyter`, then use a formatter and converter script to save them as markdown files.
