It seems like math is my jam nowadays, so I decided to write another post on this topic---but this time, with some slightly different takes. \n",

Specifically, we will explore an alternative way of solving the Basel problem using Fourier expansion, and how it also lends insight into the convergence of the Dirichlet Eta function. Second, we will take a look at one way of expresisng the Basel problem into an integral instead of an infinite sum, and attempt to evaluate that integral to solve the Basel problem. \n",
