In this notebook, we will dive into the topic of exploratory data analysis. 


```{r load-packages, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```
```

```{r}
flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    mean_dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE), 
    mean_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  filter(count > 20) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = mean_dist, y = mean_delay)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(size = count), alpha = 1/3) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```
