    "Recently, I was compelled by my own curiosity to study SQL, a language I have heard about quite a lot but never had a chance to study. At first, SQL sounded difficult and foreign largely because it was a language fundamentally different from other programming languages I had studied, such as Java, Python, or R. However, after watching this [fantastic video tutorial] on YouTube, and completing a relevant course on DataCamp, I think I now finally have a somewhat concrete understanding of what SQL is and how to use it. Of course, I'm still so far away from being fluent in SQL, and the queries I can write are still pretty basic. Much like the [blog post on R], this post will serve as a reference for myself, as well as serving the auxiliary role of introducing how one might set up a MySQL environment locally and integrate it with Jupyter Notebook. Let's dive right into it.  "
