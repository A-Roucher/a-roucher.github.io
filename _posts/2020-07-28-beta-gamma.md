Maintaining momentum in writing and self-learning has admittedly been difficult these past few weeks since I’ve started my internship. Normally, I would write one post approximately every four days, but this routine is no longer the norm. To my defense, I’ve been learning a ton about Django and backend operations like querying and routing, and I might write a post about these in the future. 

But for today, I decided to revisit a topic we’ve previously explored on this blog, partially in the hopes of using nostalgia as positive energy in restarting my internal momentum. Let’s talk about the Betas and the Gammas. 

# Gamma Function

The overall landscape of the Beta and Gamma world is that we have two versions of both: on one hand, we have the Beta function and the Beta distribution, which is then mirrored by the Gamma function and the Gamma distribution. While we could theoretically start with any one of the four, we’ll start with the Gamma function.

## Definition

The Gamma function is written as 
$$
\Gamma(x) = \int
$$
