In a previous post, we looked at the Poisson distribution as a way of modeling the probability of some event's occurrence within a specified time frame. Specifically, we took the example of phone calls and calculated how lucky I was on the day I got only five calls during my shift, as opposed to the typical twelve. 

While we clearly established the fact that the Poisson distribution was a more accurate representation of the situation than the binomial distribution, we ran into a problem at the end of the post: how can we derive or integrate the Poisson probability distribution, which is discontinuous? To recap, let's reexamine the Poisson distribution function:

</script>

$$P(X = k) = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} e^{- \lambda} \frac{\lambda^k}{k!}$$

As you can see, this function is discontinuous because of that one factorial term shamelessly flaunting itself in the denominator. The factorial, we might recall, is as an operation is only defined for integers. Therefore, although we can calculate expression such as $$7!$$, we have no idea what the expression $$0.5!$$ evaluates to. 

Or do we?

Here is where the gamma function kicks in. This is going to be the crux of today's post. 

# The Gamma Function

Let's jump right in by analyzing the Gamma function in its integral form:

$$\Gamma(n + 1) = \int_0^\infty x^n e^{-x} \, dx$$

At a glance, it is not immediately clear as to why this integral is an [interpolation] of the factorial function. However, if we try to evaluate this expression through integration by parts, the picture becomes clearer:

$$\int_0^\infty x^n e^{-x} \, dx = - x^n e^{-x} \Big|_{0}^{\infty}$$
