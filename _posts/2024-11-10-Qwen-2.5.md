**🔥 Qwen releases their 2.5 family of models: New SOTA for all sizes up to 72B!**

The Chinese LLM maker just dropped a flurry of different models, ensuring there will be a Qwen SOTA model for every application out there:

- Qwen2.5: 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B, 7B, 14B, 32B, and 72B
- Qwen2.5-Coder: 1.5B, 7B, and 32B on the way
- Qwen2.5-Math: 1.5B, 7B, and 72B.

**Key insights:**

🌐 All models have **128k token** context length

📚 Models pre-trained on 18T tokens, even longer than the 15T of Llama-3

💪 The flagship **Qwen2.5-72B is ~competitive with Llama-3.1-405B, and has a 3-5% margin on Llama-3.1-70B on most benchmarks**.

🇫🇷 On top of this, it **takes the #1 spot on multilingual tasks** so it might become my standard for French

💻 **Qwen2.5-Coder is only 7B but beats competing models up to 33B** (DeeSeek-Coder 33B-Instruct)

🧮 Qwen2.5-Math sets a new high in the ratio of MATH benchmark score to # of parameters. They trained it by "aggregating more high-quality mathematical data, particularly in Chinese, from web sources, books, and codes across multiple recall cycles."

📄 Technical report to be released "very soon"

🔓 All models have the most permissive license apache2.0, except the 72B models that have a custom license mentioning "you can use it for free EXCEPT if your product has over 100M users"

🤗 All models are available on the HF Hub! ➡️ [https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qwen25-66e81a666513e518adb90d9e](https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qwen25-66e81a666513e518adb90d9e)
