so far on this blog, all posts were written using markdown. markdown is very easy and learnable even for novices like me, but an issue i had was the inconvenience of integrating texts, code, and figures organically in one coherent file. that is why i decided to experiment with jupyter notebook, which i had meant to use and learn for a very long time. in this post, we will test the functionality of jupyter notebook by trying out various visualization tools available in python. in the next post, i will introduce the method i utilized toconvert this file into format to display it on our static website. hello world we can also use libraries to create visualizations. shown below is a simple representation of a sine graph created using and . let's step up the game a bit. here is a simple experimentation with subplots with the package again. next, we use to see if basic spreadsheet functionalities can be displayed on jupyter. 0 1 2 3 4 0 0.119558 0.632469 2.176383 0.310280 0.480731 1 0.285325 0.184601 0.808425 0.191247 0.562904 2 0.305665 2.057085 0.191773 0.217347 0.713348 3 0.608312 0.028068 0.222626 0.760257 1.193710 4 0.627122 1.325584 0.504316 0.079908 0.051234 we can visualize this toy data using the function, much like we created visualizations with above. is another powerful data visualization framework. it is based off of , but also contains graphing functionalities that its parent does not, such as heatmaps. pair plots are used to visualize multidimensional data. we can see pair plots in action by using the function. below are visualizations created using one of 's default data set. also contains a joint plot graphing functionality that allows us to group multiple graphs into one compact figure, as demonstrated below. the last example we will take a look at is the in . s are used when there is a lot of noise in the data. this is a quick check to see if equations can properly be displayed on jupyter using mathjax. here is the cross product formula . this is enough jupyter for today! once i fully familiarize myself with jupyter, perhaps i will write more posts using this platform.
