🤗 I'm very proud to have supported [**CGIAR**]([https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)) and [**Digital Green**]([https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)) in making Farmer.chat, an app that supports 20k smallholder farmers on a daily basis 🌾

There are ~500 million smallholder farmers globally, playing a critical role in global food security. Having access to accurate information is essential for them.

💬 An “agricultural extension service” offers technical advice on agriculture, and also supplies farmers with the necessary inputs and services to support their agricultural production.

But agriculture extension agents are not in large enough numbers to cope with all the requests, especially in countries like Kenya, India, Ethiopia, and Nigeria.

🚀 So the team set out to build an app called Farmer.Chat, to provide an agricultural extension service, by building on the immense knowledge accumulated by [**CGIAR**]([https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)).

✨ The app is technically impressive: behind the Whatsapp-type UX, an agent interprets the user's intent, and identifies which tool to call to best answer their request: weather API, RAG on a CGIAR-provided knowledge base, market data, etc. The RAG on the knowledge base is in itself a work of art.

🎯 A key part of building such a complex system is to be able to evaluate it properly. During our bi-weekly sessions with the team, I could support them in  implementing the method called "LLM-as-a-judge" to tackle this problem.

It worked really well. Due to the amazing work of the team, the app now successfully answered over 300 thousand requests, in 6 different languages, and it's still growing!
