Welcome to my personal website! My name is Jake (Jaesung) Tae, and I am a sophomore at Yale University working towards a Bachelors of Science in Statistics and Data Science (currently on an authorized leave of absence for military service).

Currently, I am working as an assistant to the Provost Marshall and Radio Telecommunications Operator at the 142nd Military Policy Company of the 8th Army. My primary responsibility includes responding to emergency calls to minimize any potential damages to life and property, maintaining real-time communication with MP patrols, and overseeing law enforcement and on-post security at USAG Yongsan, Seoul. While there is a lot on my shoulders, I am learning something new each day at work, and I am proud to play my part in the army as an intermediary between Korea and the U.S. 

My academic interests are diversified, but I am particularly intrigued by the statistical and mathematical underpinnings of machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks, such as the stochastic process, gradient descent, and various other optimization techniques. As unbelievable as it sounds, the two introductory math classes I took during my first year, Math 120 and 222, have been two of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale to date, and I wish to continue my exploration of this subject area when I return to continue my studies as a sophomore in 2021. 

In my free time, I love watching soccer (the real football--a hot take, I know. But I've been in the Yale Precision Marching Band so my love for American football is also there), playing the guitar (both accoustic and electric, in case you were wonodering), eating my way through hidden hole in the wall restaurants (well-known restaurants are good, but the real gems tend to be concealed from the eyes of the masses), and writing long sentences riddled with commas and parantheses. I'm also interested in consumer tech, although ironically I'm still rocking my 10-year-old Samsung desktop running Windows 7 at home. 

This blog is intended as a diary of sorts, functioning as a repository where I keep various records of my life, display projects I dabble in for fun, and write about the large and small, significant and the insignificant (mostly) out of arbitrary whim. Hope you enjoy reading as much as I  enjoy writing!
