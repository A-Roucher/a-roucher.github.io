Welcome to my personal website! My name is Jaesung (Jake) Tae, and I am a sophomore at Yale University, working towards a Bachelors of Science in Statistics and Data Science. I am currently  most interested in neural networks and deep learning algorithms. Aside from those, I also love watching soccer (the real footballâ€”a hot take, I know), playing the guitar, and eating my way through hole in the wall restaurants.

This blog is where I keep various records of my life, display projects I dabble in for fun, and write about the large and small, significant and the insignificant (mostly) out of arbitrary whim. Hope you enjoy reading as much as I  enjoy writing!
