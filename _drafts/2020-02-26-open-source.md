Programming is difficult but fun. Or maybe it's the other way around. Either way, any  developer would know that external libraries are something that makes programming so much easier. As a Pythonista with an interest in deep learning, I cannot image a world without essential libraries like `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, or `tensorflow`. It simply be  impossible, at least for me, to achieve everything from scratch without using these libraries. 

It is only a few days ago that it dawned to me that all of the modules I frequently use are open source, publicly available and accessible on GitHub. This not only meant that I could take a look at what happens under the hood when I use import statements or call internal functions, but also that I could actively contribute to maintaining and improving these libraries myself. This realization came to me roughly at a time when I was looking into a program called [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com), which provides a systematic platform for students enrolled in tertiary institutions to contribute to a specific open source project alongside a designated mentor. Unfortunately, I was not eligible for this program due to my being on an authorized leave of absence; however, I decided that it would be great to contribute to an open source library and decided to embark on this journey nonetheless. And of course, with that decision came a number of different hurdles... and a sweet taste of fruition at last.
