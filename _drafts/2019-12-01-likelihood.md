"I think that's very unlikely."

"No, you're probably right."

These are just some of the many remarks we use in every day conversations to express our beliefs. Linguistically, words such as "probably" or "likely" serve to qualify the strength of our professed belief, that is, we express a degree of uncertainty involved with a given statement. 

In today's post, I suggest that we scrutinize the concept of likelihood---what it is, how we calculate it, and most importantly, how different it is from probability. Although the vast majority of us tend to conflate likelihood and probability in daily conversations, mathematically speaking, these two are distinct concepts, though closely related. After concretizing this difference, we then move onto a discussion of maximum likelihood, which is a useful tool frequently employed in Bayesian statistics. Without further ado, let's jump right in.

# Likelihood

As we have seen in an [earlier post] on Bayesian statistical analysis, likelihood refers to
