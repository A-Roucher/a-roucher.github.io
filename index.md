Welcome to my personal website! My name is Jake (Jaesung) Tae, and I am a sophomore at Yale University working towards a Bachelors of Science in Statistics and Data Science (currently on an authorized leave of absence for mandatory military service in South Korea).

Currently, I am working as a Radio Telecommunications Operator and an assistant to the Provost Marshall at the 142nd Military Policy Company of the 8th U.S. Army. My primary responsibilities include responding to emergency calls, maintaining real-time communication with the military police and the Korean National Police, and overseeing law enforcement at U.S. Army Garrison-Yongsan, Seoul. While there are a lot on my shoulders, I am learning something new each day, and I am proud to play my part as a member of the Korean Augmentation to the U.S. Army.

My academic interests are diversified, but I am particularly intrigued by the mathematical and statistical underpinnings of machine learning algorithms, such as the stochastic process, Bayesian inference, Markov chains, Monte Carlo simulations, and more. I have also recently started to cultivate a budding interest in real analysis. As odd as it may sound, the two introductory math classes I took during my first year, MATH 120 (Multivariable Calculus) and MATH 222 (Linear Algebra), have been two of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale. I wish to continue my exploration of relevant subject areas when I return to New Haven to continue my studies as a sophomore in 2021. 

In my free time, I love watching soccer (the real football--a hot take, I know. But I've been in the Yale Precision Marching Band so my love for American football is also there), playing the guitar (both acoustic and electric, in case you were wondering), eating my way through hidden hole in the wall restaurants (well-known restaurants are good, but the real gems tend to be hidden from the eyes of the masses), and writing long sentences riddled with commas and parentheses. I'm also interested in consumer tech and new product releases, although  I'm still rocking my 10-year-old Samsung desktop running Windows 7 at home. 

This blog is intended as a diary of sorts, functioning as a repository where I keep various records of my life, display projects I dabble in for fun, and write about the large and small, significant and the insignificant (mostly) out of arbitrary whim. When I study on my own, I tend to go down many rabbit holes, so I hope you can bear with the ostensibly random selection of topics on my blog. Anyway, I hope you enjoy reading as much as I  enjoy writing!
