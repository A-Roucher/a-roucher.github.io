:wave: Welcome to my blog! My name is Jake (Jaesung) Tae, and I'm a sophomore at Yale University working towards a Bachelors of Science in Statistics and Data Science (currently on an authorized leave of absence for mandatory military service in South Korea).

These days, I am working as a Radio Telecommunications Operator and an assistant to the Provost Marshall at the 142nd Military Policy Company, 8th U.S. Army. My primary responsibilities include responding to emergency calls, maintaining real-time communication with patrols and the Korean National Police, and overseeing law enforcement at U.S. Army Garrison-Yongsan, Seoul. At work, I'm learning something new each day, and I am proud to play my part as a member of the [Korean Augmentation to the U.S. Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Augmentation_To_the_United_States_Army).

My interests are diverse, but I am particularly fascinated by the mathematical and statistical underpinnings of machine learning and deep learning models. While I'm a skeptic who believes that artificial intelligence will never achieve human-level  understanding of emotion or empathy, I strongly believe that the development and application of deep learning models will transform the world for the better. I'll also stick in here the fact that I'm a proud Pythonista and a firm advocate of open sourcing.

In my free time, I love watching soccer (the real football--a hot take, I know. But I've been in the Yale Precision Marching Band so my love for football is also there), playing the guitar (acoustic finger style, to be exact), eating my way through hole in the wall restaurants (the dingy, small ones are often better than the huge, fancy ones), and writing long sentences full of commas and parentheses. I'm also interested in consumer tech, although  I'm still rocking my 10-year-old AMD-powered Samsung desktop running Windows 7 at home. Yes, I used AMD way before it became cool.

This blog is intended as a diary of sorts, a repository where I keep various records of my life, display projects I dabble in for fun, and write about the large and small, significant and the insignificant out of arbitrary whim. When I study on my own, I tend to go down many rabbit holes, so I hope you can bear with the ostensibly random selection of topics on my blog. Anyway, I hope you enjoy reading as much as I  enjoy writing!
